Feeding Frenzy is a slackbot which will post pictures and description of the food served each day at the Qualtrics Seattle office. This saves developers time because they donâ€™t have to click on the calendar, while lowering the ambiguity within the office, thus making Qualtrics a more productive environment. We estimate that this will save each developer about a minute a day. With 200 engineers working about 260 days a year, it adds up to 840 hours of developer time. This will save Qualtrics hella money.
